  In this work, we introduce an adaptive representational alignment strategy for multi-modal learning based on the rank associated with an SVD matrix decomposition. The intuition behind this work is to ensure an equal contribution of information from both modalities. We show theoretical and empirical analyses across multi-modal fusion frameworks with a focus on time series video recognition tasks.
