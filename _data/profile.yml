    My name is Kiran Kokilepersaud. I am a final year PhD student in the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the 
    Georgia Institute of Technology. I work in the <a href="https://alregib.ece.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">OLIVES Lab</a> under Professor Ghassan AlRegib on <b>Core Machine Learning Research</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research targets understanding self supervised algorithms (SSL) from both a theoretical and application specific perspective.
    Specifically, I work on applying concepts from information theory to motivate the design of SSL algorithms as well as to explain exactly how they work.
    My work has been applied within medical, autonomous driving, seismology, and general machine learning problems.
    I love machine learning amd artificial intelligence as a discipline and I am interested in a wide range of works in the field!
